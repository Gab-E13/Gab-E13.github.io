			<h1>User Profile: Gabriel P-1</h1>
			<p>Welcome to my personal corner of the web... A 2nd year's escape from C++, Java, SQL and other wacknots (I am a bit wacky with back end programming but I could try to look into it and help folks with it.)</p>

			<h3>Arduino Sound Detection Device</h3>
			<p>This is well a research project me and a colleague are working on... This is more private since it's a college studies thingie were working on, although maybe one day I could put a repository on it here... So stay tuned for that if ya'll are interested.</p>

			<h3>Java and C++ Logic Design</h3>
			<p>Various programs I made with the two programming languages I am currently learning and practicing in College... In all honesty I am not good with it regardless of what other folks say... But I do try to at least learn it and make sense of it to help other folks with it... Feel free to drop some tips on it.</p>

			<h3>Fictional Worldbuilding</h3>
			<p>As I said earlier I made this website (eventhough my mehtodology or README.txt is very confusing) for my Fictional Nation the Republik of Draga... At the moment I am working on further bolstering it for a brighter fictional future ahead... More info on it will be written on a differnt side of this wack ahhh blog or website.</p>

[Projekt Personality]

[Introduction]
This is Projekt Personality, a project that aims to expand my archive or well to probably bolster my hobby experience on the Republik of Draga, a fictional nation in a nation roleplay called ARDA: Nation Roleplay... This project will also feature a bit about me thee author of the Republik of Draga, although technically it will contain mostly information about my vehicles but at the same time I could inject a bit of my nations lore.

[Goal]
To make a little website for my hobby

[Status]
Well its just starting, but I'll try to see it through

[About me?]
A wack ass CS student specializing in SE who realized late into 2nd year that I was fit more to be a FrontEnd Developer... This project is well inspired by that dream... I know that Im not as great as the other great FrontEnd Devs but I wish to be with them one day with the tools that are available at hand. Feel free to support me.
